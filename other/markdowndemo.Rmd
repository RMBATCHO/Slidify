My First R Markdown File
========================

This is my first R markdown file.

Here, we're going to load some data.

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```    

Let's first make a pairs plot of the data.

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here is a regression model of ozone on wind, solar rediation, and temperature.

```{r fitmodel}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp + Solar.R, data = airquality)
```

```{r showtable, results='asis'}
library(xtable)
xt <- xtable(summary(fit))
print(xt, type = "html")
```
